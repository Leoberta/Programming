TESTING
-bug : code beahves diffrently from the documentation
-error: code behaves diffrently from what is written to do (so documentation is fundamental)

-types of test
    we want to test if a function is correct, what kind of test can be done?

    advancement test: edits to the function introduce the new features I deside
    regressions test: edits to the function do not lose functionality that other code relies on

-pytest is a command line program that:
    search all the current directory for *.py files
    in each one of those, search all the functions named test_<something>
    execute all of them and keep track of the results
    prints a summary of the tests


Overwriting test_prova.py

!pytest test_prova.py
